## 🏡 Hightlights
* We propose Vad-R1, a novel end-to-end MLLM-based framework tailored for VAR, which aims at further analysis and understanding of anomalies in the video.
* We design a structured Perception-to-Cognition Chain-of-Thought, and construct Vad-Reasoning, a specially designed dataset for video anomaly reasoning with two subsets. Besides, we propose an improved reinforcement learning algorithm AVA-GRPO, which incentivizes the reasoning capability of MLLMs through a self verification way.
* The experimental results show that the proposed Vad-R1 achieves superior performance across multiple evaluation scenarios, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models in video anomaly detection and reasoning tasks.
